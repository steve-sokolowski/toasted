Client website for the gameshow "Toasted."

Bugs noticed in Toasted

1.	Only Google Chrome supports FLAC and is therefore the only browser that can be used with the viewer
2.	Participants have issues with their phones disconnecting from wamp between rounds.  They need to refresh the page before each round to avoid the issue.
3.	When the projector is turned off between rounds, the list of sound devices in the computer changes, and the browser no longer outputs sound.  Either the projector needs to be left on or the browser needs to be closed then re-opened when the monitor configuration is changed.
4.	The outro music can play multiple times if clicked multiple times
5.	The “black screen” is actually a yellow screen
6.	The countdown timer is not synchronized among users.
7.	The countdown timer is not synchronized with the music
8.	Users can generally only see five answers at the same time on one cell phone screen
9.	Very long team names can take up too much space on a cell phone display obscuring answer choices.
10.  The timestamp used to subtract the time remaining on the client is the local time, so the number of points displayed may be more or less than what the server's timestamp actually adds.
